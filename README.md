# Pong

Implementation of the game 'Pong', done as a project at NYU. <br />
Finished on April 5, 2023. 

## How to play

When the program runs, the game automatically begins. <br />

Move your cursor up and down to hit the ball against the wall until you lose it! <br />

Score depends on how long you survived. <br />

There will be special changes to the game if you reach a specific time.
